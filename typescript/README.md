# Typescript Patterns

Contains useful patterns I use for Typescript.

- api
    - api-client-axios
    
        A basic example of a abstracted API class around Axios.
        This example also uses a response handler which could
        then be tested.

    - type-narrowing

        Examples of how to narrow axios responses and errors.
        These examples can be expanded upon to narrow a variety
        of types and parameters.
